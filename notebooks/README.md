# notebooks

The various notebooks in this directory are described in the sections below.

## sorting_data

The list of all relevant runs is reviewed, and a master table is provided with detail on every configuration and storage time. A few specific runs requiring additional spectrum cuts are reviewed.

## p_beam_data

The proton beam data is reviewed. The proton beam data appears to have a timing offset with respect to the main detector run data. A failed attempt is made to identify the exact coincidence of the runs and the current measurements.

## monitor_detector

The data from the monitor detector is reviewed.

## sD2_normalization 

The total UCN production rate appears to decline over time. This is a known effect whose mechanism is a build-up of a frost layer on the sD2 source. Fits are performed to the data collected in the nominal, guide-less, configuration, to determine the rate at which UCN are being lost. These loss rates are used to normalize the counts of all runs in all other configurations, to effectively correct these losses out of the data. 

## storage_lifetime

Storage lifetime is computed for every configuration, and found to have generally tight agreement. 

## transmission

Transmission measurements are produced for each configuration.

## time_constant

Necessary for the simulations, the time constant of the decay following the mauin detection peak is analyzed, across various configurations and pre-storage times.

## workspace

Nothing in here is directly relevant to the analysis. Mainly experimentation with various tools.
