# sim

All analysis, inputs and outputs from simulations are contained in this directory. 

## Input

There are directories for each configuration, labelled by guide and pre-storage time. The input directories have the 'in' suffix. These directories contain the STL files for the configuration model, the various config*.in files for PENTrack, and corresponding batch*.sh files for running on computecanada clusters. There are also materials*.in files corresponding to each config*.in

## Output

There are directories labelled by configuration AND pre-storage time for all the outputs. Refer to the simAnalysis.py script within each of these directories for detail on the output data and performed analysis.

## Archive

Just old simulation files that I am no longer using.
