# TR_norm_in

STL files are in the STL folder.

## Questions

1) How do we appropriately choose the number of particles for simulation, and the maximum simulation time? I'm just borrowing Stewart's choices for now. Are these OK?
2) For now, I will just tune the diffuse reflection probability of NiMo, since that is the material of the source, plexi guides, and pre-storage volume. It's presently set to zero, how can we perform this tuning iteratively? 

## Tasks

As a proof of concept, we should submit a batch that simulates the TR_norm configuration at 5, 20, and 100s storage times. Need help here.
