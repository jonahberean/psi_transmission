# psi_transmission

This repository contains scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and other documents used for analysis of the UCN guide transmission experiment, carried out in December of 2017 at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch/en). This file provides an overview of the repository contents.

## data 

Notably missing from the repository are the experimental data, which can be found on the main UCN cluster at the following path: **/ucn/orithyia_data/psi_transmission/name-of-data-folder**

There are four such data folders:

1. **data_main_detector** - UCN count data as collected by the main detector.
2. **data_monitor_detector** - UCN count date as collected by the monitor detector.
3. **data_p_beam_2s** - Proton beam current measurements collected every 2 seconds throughout the experiment.
4. **data_p_beam_10s** - Proton beam current measurements collected every 10 seconds throughout the experiment.

There is a separate README.md file within each of these data sub-directories, describing the respective contents. 

## elog

There are .html, .txt, and .pdf versions of the elog available in the **elog** sub-folder.

## notebooks and scripts

In the **notebooks** and **scripts** folders, there are tools and demonstrations of the pre-storage lifetime and transmission analyses performed. Refer to the self-contained documentation for details.

## documents and img

Some relevant articles, and reports are provided. 

## to-do

- my latex report should be pushed via overleaf to this repo.
