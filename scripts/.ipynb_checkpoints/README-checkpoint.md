# scripts

There are two script files in this folder. 

The first is the **functions.py** file which contains every function used in the analysis. These functions are called in the various notebooks provided in the eponymous folder. 

The second file is an example script file containing c++ code that could be used for analysis in ROOT. None of the analysis within this repository has used ROOT. This script was provided by Edgard Pierre.
